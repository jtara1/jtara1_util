# jtara1_util

## Deprecated

can replace with `from loguru import logger` or I'll have to make more specific python modules

I have several personal modules using this.

## About

Centralized source for common functions and operations I've done throughout multiple modules

This'll included higher level functions for operations done with files and tools
for web scraping.

## Install

`pip install git+https://github.com/jtara1/jtara1_util`

## Usage

```
import jtara1_util
logger = setup_logger() 
```
